Description: 
    This package implements a comprehensive framework for 
    analyzing tennis betting results using an Elo rating 
    system. It provides functions for downloading tennis data, fitting the Elo rating for every player, 
    simulating tournaments, 
    calculating betting outcomes, and evaluating performance 
    metrics such as return on investment (ROI). 
    The package draws inspiration from V. Candila's work on 
    the "welo" package, utilizing useful functions from it 
    to enhance its functionality. Ensure the packages "welo" and "Rlab" are installed
