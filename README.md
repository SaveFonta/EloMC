### Functions

#### `merged_tennis_data`

```R
\name{merged_tennis_data}
\alias{merged_tennis_data}
\title{Merge Tennis Match Data from Multiple Years}
\description{
  The \code{merged_tennis_data} function retrieves and merges ATP or WTA tennis match datasets from the years 2013 to 2024 based on the specified gender. The matches are downloaded from the archive of \url{www.tennis-data.co.uk} and involves match data for: ATP250, ATP500, ATP1000 and Grand Slams.
}
\usage{
  merged_tennis_data(gender = "ATP")
}
\arguments{
  \item{gender}{
    A character string indicating the gender of the tennis players.
    It can be either \code{"ATP"} for male players or \code{"WTA"} for female players. The default value is \code{"ATP"}.
  }
}
\details{
  This function uses the \code{\link[welo]{tennis_data}} function from the \code{welo} package, authored by V. Candila, to load ATP or WTA tennis match datasets for each year from 2013 to 2024, depending on the specified gender. The data is combined into a single data frame, and unnecessary columns (e.g., \code{SJW}, \code{SJL}, \code{EXW}, \code{EXL}, \code{LBW}, \code{LBL}) are removed to prepare the data for further analysis.

  The resulting data frame includes the following columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{ATP/WTA}: The association of the tournament (either ATP for men or WTA for women).
    \item \strong{Location}: The location of the tournament.
    \item \strong{Tournament}: The name of the tournament.
    \item \strong{Date}: The date of the match.
    \item \strong{Series}: The category of the tournament.
    \item \strong{Court}: The type of court.
    \item \strong{Surface}: The surface type.
    \item \strong{Round}: The round of the match.
    \item \strong{Best of}: The best-of format of the match.
    \item \strong{Winner}: The name of the winning player.
    \item \strong{Loser}: The name of the losing player.
    \item \strong{WRank}: The ranking of the winner.
    \item \strong{LRank}: The ranking of the loser.
    \item \strong{WPts}: Points awarded to the winner.
    \item \strong{LPts}: Points awarded to the loser.
    \item \strong{W1, L1, ..., W5, L5}: Scores for each set of the match.
    \item \strong{Wsets}: Total sets won by the winner.
    \item \strong{Lsets}: Total sets won by the loser.
    \item \strong{Comment}: Additional comments regarding the match.
    \item \strong{B365W, B365L}: Betting odds for the winner and loser from Bet365.

###
#### `clean_data`

```R
\name{clean_data}
\alias{clean_data}
\title{Clean and Preprocess Tennis Match Data for Elo Rating Computation}
\description{
The \code{clean_data} function processes a data frame of tennis match data by removing rows with missing values and renaming specific columns as necessary. This preparation is essential for using the \code{\link{compute_elo}} function, which computes Elo ratings for all players involved. When \code{WELO = TRUE}, the function also calculates statistics needed for estimating the WElo rating as proposed by Angelini et al. (2022).
}
\usage{
clean_data(x, WELO = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A data frame obtained using the function \code{\link{merged_tennis_data}}, containing tennis match data. The data frame must include the following columns: \code{Location}, \code{Tournament}, \code{Date}, \code{Series}, \code{Surface}, \code{Round}, \code{Winner}, and \code{Loser}. If any of these required columns are missing, the function will halt and return an error message.
}
  \item{WELO}{
Logical; default is \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function calculates additional statistics on the fraction of games and sets won by both the winner and the loser, enabling estimation of the WElo rating, which factors in match dominance.
}
}
\value{
A cleaned data frame ready for Elo rating computation using \code{\link{compute_elo}}. This data frame includes all necessary match information, with optional WElo rating variables when \code{WELO = TRUE}. If WElo statistics are calculated, they are added as new columns representing the fraction of games and sets won by the winner and loser, supporting WElo rating computation.
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
    \item \strong{Validation:} Checks that the input \code{x} is a data frame and verifies the presence of required columns.
    \item \strong{Data Cleaning:} Removes any rows with missing values in the essential columns.
    \item \strong{Column Renaming:} If a column named \code{Tier} exists, it is renamed to \code{Series} to standardize column names.
    \item \strong{WElo Computation:} If \code{WELO = TRUE}, additional calculations are performed to add columns for the fraction of games and sets won by the winner and the loser. These statistics are necessary for WElo rating computation, based on the approach detailed by Angelini et al. (2022).
}
This function is designed to handle the output from \code{\link{merged_tennis_data}}, ensuring compatibility for Elo rating calculations with \code{\link{compute_elo}} and other related functions.

\title{
Calculate Elo Ratings for Tennis Matches with Adjustments
}
\description{
The \code{compute_elo} function calculates Elo ratings for tennis players based on match outcomes, incorporating adjustments for surface types and tournament significance. The function supports standard Elo ratings and variations such as surface-adjusted Elo and surface-specific Elo ratings. It can also generate confidence intervals and custom weights to refine rating computations. The function can optionally calculate WElo ratings, which incorporate additional match performance data. \cr

The function was designed to further simulate tennis tournament and it is the input for the function \code{\link{define_tournament}}.
}
\usage{
compute_elo(x, W = "GAMES", SP = 1500, K = "Kovalchik", s = 0.5,
            CI = FALSE, alpha = 0.05, B = 1000, WELO = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    A data frame (possibly obtained using the function \code{\link{clean_data}}) containing match results with required columns for winners, losers, and match metadata (e.g., \code{Date}, \code{Series}, \code{Round}, \code{Surface}, \code{Comment}).
  }
  \item{W}{
    A character string specifying the type of weighting to apply. Options include \code{"GAMES"} or \code{"SETS"}. The default is \code{"GAMES"}.
  }
  \item{SP}{
    A numeric value representing the starting Elo rating assigned to all players. The default is \code{1500}.
  }
  \item{K}{
    Either a character string or numeric value specifying the K-factor used for Elo rating adjustments. Options include \code{"Kovalchik"}, \code{"Grand_Slam"}, \code{"Surface_Hard"}, \code{"Surface_Clay"}, \code{"Surface_Grass"}, or a numeric K-value. Default is \code{"Kovalchik"}.
  }
  \item{s}{
    A numeric scaling factor applied to adjust K-factor values based on tournament significance. The default is \code{0.5}.
  }
  \item{CI}{
    A logical value indicating whether to calculate confidence intervals for Elo predictions. The default is \code{FALSE}.
  }
  \item{alpha}{
    A numeric value for the significance level when calculating confidence intervals. The default is \code{0.05}.
  }
  \item{B}{
    An integer specifying the number of bootstrap samples used for confidence interval estimation. The default is \code{1000}.
  }
  \item{WELO}{
    A logical value indicating whether to calculate WElo ratings, which incorporate additional match performance data. The default is \code{FALSE}.
  }
}
\details{
The Elo rating system estimates the probability that player i will win against player j in a match at time t as follows:

\deqn{\hat{p}_{i,j}(t) = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(E_j(t) - E_i(t))/400}}}

The Elo rating for player i is then updated based on match results:

\deqn{E_i(t + 1) = E_i(t) + K_i(t) \left [W_i(t) - \hat{p}_{i,j}(t)\right]}

Where:
\itemize{
  \item W_i(t): Binary indicator (1 if player i wins, 0 otherwise).
  \item K_i(t): Constant factor determining the magnitude of rating adjustments, which can vary based on match significance or surface type.
}

This function also supports surface-specific Elo ratings and WElo ratings, where WElo further incorporates match dominance indicators. Different K-factor options adjust the Elo updates according to match conditions such as surface and tournament significance. For example, adjustments for Grand Slam tournaments or specific surfaces are made by setting parameter s based on match importance:

\deqn{S =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if match is significant (e.g., Grand Slam)} \\
s & \text{otherwise, where \( s < 1 \)}
\end{cases}}

The S factor is then used to adjust the rating update:
\deqn{E_i(t + 1) = E_i(t) + K_i(t) \left [W_i(t) - \hat{p}_{i,j}(t)\right] S}


Confidence intervals are optionally computed using a bootstrap approach, and custom weights can be applied to tailor the rating updates.
